<h1>SMB1 Scoring Patch</h1>

<p>In the meantime, I put together a small SMB1 patch which changes the way scoring is handled. The features are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kicking a shell starts the ShellChainCounter two steps lower than it does normally - instead of starting at 500 points, it starts at 200 and must defeat two extra enemies to reach 500, then progression is normal</li>
  <li>Kicking a shell no longer allows players to attain a 1-up - instead it will add 8000 points for every kill after the first 8k kill</li>
  <li>1-up mushrooms no longer give lives - instead they add 8000 points when collected</li>
  <li>Players only receive 10 points per timer tick left at the end of level, instead of 50</li>
  <li>The highest tier of the flagpole only gives 4000 bonus points</li>
  <li>Bowser gives 8000 points if fire-killed</li>
  <li>The Koopa Troopas at the end of 3-1 are replaced with Goombas</li>
</ul>

<p>Sound like fun? Check out the <a href="smbscore.zip">patch</a> and apply it to a Super Mario Bros. US ROM.</p>
